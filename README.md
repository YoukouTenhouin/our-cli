# Command line interface for OUR

This is the command line interface for [openSUSE User Repository](https://hackweek.opensuse.org/25/projects/our-opensuse-user-repositiory).

## Usage

At this stage there is no server-side implementation yet. However, you can try out the local building feature by using:

```
$ our build <specfile>
```

For a demo package, see [our-cli-pkg](https://github.com/YoukouTenhouin/our-cli-pkg).

More available commands can be obtained with `our help`.
